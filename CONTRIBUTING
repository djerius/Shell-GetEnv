What to Contribute?
===================

Very welcome:

* Documentation
* Tests
* New functionality
* Typos.

Things that might take some convincing:

* Functionality that's too far from the core purpose of

  (non-invasive changes are welcome!)

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

* Courtesy is always rewarded. Courtesy is expected from contributers
  and project members.

* Code should be as cross platform as possible. Please use core
  facilities whenever possible, unless the project already uses a
  non-core module which provides better interface or functionality

* Add only necessary dependencies.

* Please communicate via the request tracker prior to making major changes.  There may be
  competing interests that need to be accomodated.

* Keep commits small and targeted.  It is much easier to review and
  understand them.
